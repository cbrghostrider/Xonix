# Xonix
Haskell implementation of the old game Xonix. My first serious Haskell project.

Although I learnt a terrific amount from my first Haskell project (Monads, HOpenGL, Collision detection, keyboard, rendering, etc), I was very new to Haskell. The source code is a bit painful, but I still love the outcome. :)

For a short demo video, search for "Haskell Xonix" on youtube.
